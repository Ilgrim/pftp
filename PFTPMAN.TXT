Documentation for pftp/pftpstik
===============================
Both pftp and pftpstik are FTP clients for use with plain TOS.  The only
difference between the two is that pftp uses some STinG extensions and
so can only be used with STinG.  pftpstik should work with either.  In
the following document, unless otherwise specified, pftp means pftp OR
pftpstik.

SYNOPSIS
     pftp [-pinegvd] [host [port]]

DESCRIPTION
     Options may be specified at the command line, or to the command
     interpreter.

     -p    Don't use passive mode for data transfers.  By default, passive
           mode is used, which allows the use of ftp in environments
           where a firewall prevents connections from the outside world
           back to the client machine.  Passive mode requires that the
           ftp server support the PASV command; if the server doesn't,
           use this option.

     -i    Turns off interactive prompting during multiple file transfers.

     -g    Disables file name globbing.

     -v    Verbose option forces ftp to show all responses from the remote
           server, as well as report on data transfer statistics.

     -d    Enables debugging.

     The client host and an optional port number with which pftp is to
     communicate may be specified on the command line.  If this is done,
     pftp will immediately attempt to establish a connection to an FTP
     server on that host; otherwise, pftp will enter its command interpreter
     and await instructions from the user.  When pftp is awaiting commands
     from the user, the prompt "ftp>" is provided to the user.  The
     following commands are recognized by pftp:

     ascii       Set the file transfer type to network ASCII.

     bell        Arrange that a bell be sounded after each file transfer
                 command is completed.

     binary      Set the file transfer type to support binary image
                 transfer.  This is the default type.

     bye         Terminate the FTP session with the remote server and exit
                 pftp.

     cd remote-directory
                 Change the working directory on the remote machine to
                 remote-directory.

     cdup        Change the remote machine working directory to the parent
                 of the current remote machine working directory.

     close       Terminate the FTP session with the remote server, and
                 return to TOS.

     delete remote-file
                 Delete the file remote-file on the remote machine.

     debug [debug-value]
                 Toggle debugging mode.  If an optional debug-value is
                 specified it is used to set the debugging level.  When
                 debugging is on, pftp prints each command sent to the
                 remote machine, preceded by the string "--->".

     dir [remote-directory [local-file]]
                 Print a listing of the contents of remote-directory, and,
                 optionally, place the output in local-file.  If no local
                 file is specified, output comes to the terminal.  If no
                 directory is specified, the current working directory on
                 the remote machine is used.

     disconnect  A synonym for close.

     get remote-file [local-file]
                 Retrieve the remote-file and store it on the local machine.
                 If the local file name is not specified, it is given the
                 same name it has on the remote machine.  The current
                 setting for type is used while transferring the file.

     glob        Toggle filename expansion for mdelete, mget and mput.  If
                 globbing is turned off with glob, the file name arguments
                 are taken literally and not expanded.  Globbing for mput is
                 done using standard TOS wildcards.  For mdelete and mget,
                 each remote file name is expanded separately on the remote
                 machine and the lists are not merged.

     help [command]
                 Print an informative message about the meaning of command.
                 If no argument is given, pftp prints a list of the known
                 commands.

     lcd [directory]
                 Change the working directory on the local machine.  If no
                 directory is specified, the directory used is the one that
                 was current when pftp was started.

     ls [remote-directory [local-file]]
                 Print a listing of the contents of a directory on the
                 remote machine.  The listing includes any system-dependent
                 information that the server chooses to include; for
                 example, most UNIX systems will produce output from the
                 command "ls -l" (see also nlist).  If no local file is
                 specified, the output is sent to the terminal.  If
                 remote-directory is left unspecified, the current working
                 directory is used.

     mdelete [remote-files]
                 Delete the remote-files on the remote machine.

     mget remote-files
                 Expand the remote-files on the remote machine and do a get
                 for each file name thus produced.  See glob for details on
                 the filename expansion.  Files are transferred into the
                 local working directory, which can be changed with the
                 lcd command.

     mkdir directory-name
                 Make a directory on the remote machine.

     mput local-files
                 Expand wild cards in the list of local files given as
                 arguments and do a put for each file in the resulting list.
                 See glob for details of filename expansion.

     nlist [remote-directory [local-file]]
                 Print a list of the files in a directory on the remote
                 machine.  If no local file is specified, the output is sent
                 to the terminal.  If remote-directory is left unspecified,
                 the current working directory is used.

     open host [port]
                 Establish a connection to the specified host FTP server.
                 An optional port number may be supplied, in which case
                 pftp will attempt to contact an FTP server at that port.

     prompt      Toggle interactive prompting.  Interactive prompting occurs
                 during multiple file transfers to allow the user to selec‚Äê
                 tively retrieve or store files.  If prompting is turned off
                 (default is on), any mget or mput will transfer all files,
                 and any mdelete will delete all files.

     put local-file [remote-file]
                 Store a local file on the remote machine.  If remote-file is
                 left unspecified, the local file name is used, excluding the
                 path prefix.  File transfer uses the current settings for type.

     pwd         Print the name of the current working directory on the remote
                 machine.

     quit        A synonym for bye.

     recv remote-file [local-file]
                 A synonym for get.

     rename from-name to-name
                 Rename the file from-name on the remote machine, to the file
                 to-name.

     rmdir directory-name
                 Delete a directory on the remote machine.

     send local-file [remote-file]
                 A synonym for put.

     status      Show the current status of ftp.

     system      Show the type of operating system running on the remote
                 machine.

     type [type-name]
                 Set the file transfer type to type-name.  If no type is
                 specified, the current type is printed.  The default type
                 is network ASCII.

     verbose     Toggle verbose mode.  In verbose mode, all responses from
                 the FTP server are displayed to the user.  In addition, if
                 verbose is on, when a file transfer completes, statistics
                 regarding the efficiency of the transfer are reported.  By
                 default, verbose is on.

     ? [command]
                 A synonym for help.

     Command arguments which have embedded spaces may be quoted with quote
     marks (").

ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER
     To abort a file transfer, use Ctrl-C.  Sending transfers will be
     immediately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending an
     ftp protocol ABOR command to the remote server, and discarding any
     further data received.

FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS
     The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file
     transfer.  The pftp program supports only the "ascii" and "image" types
     of file transfer, plus the default values for the remaining file
     transfer parameters.

BUGS
     Correct execution of many commands depends upon proper behaviour by the
     remote server.
